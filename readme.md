## Gestures
### onSwipeRight

  Should check tasks history @ todays index, add remaining pace count. 
  
  This should take into account the total already done for today
  
### onLongSwipeRight
  Edit, should bring up number entry. 
  Add to history which changes Remaining for today

### onSwipeLeft
  Should update Pace
  
    Math.ceil(remaining total / remaining days)

### onLongSwipeLeft
  Update End Date
  
  Update Count
   
    AutoFill with current Pace * remaining + Completed
    Minimum âˆ‘ completed 
    Should update Pace


### checkHistory 
  Allow for editing of previous days
  Card with SwipeLeft/SwipeRight for each date

## Ideas
  Multiple swipe options for various defaults


  Reporting/Pace updates
  * Update pace constantly?
  * Update pace in task?
  * Extrapolate total based on current

### React Native stuff
  Whats the right way to break this out into proper components?
